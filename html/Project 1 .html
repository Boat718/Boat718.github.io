            <b><i>The Ford Mustang</i></b> is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford.<br> In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate.<br> The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions

        <P>
            <b>The Honda Civic </b><I><u>(Japanese: ホンダ・シビック, Honda Shibikku)</u></I> is a line of cars manufactured by Honda. Originally a subcompact,<br> the Civic has gone through several generational changes, becoming both larger and more upscale, moving into the compact car segment. EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of 110 to 119.9 cubic feet (3,110 to 3,400 L) is considered a mid-size car,<br> and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-end mid-size car, although it still competes in the compact class.[2] The Civic coupé is still considered a compact car. The Civic currently falls between the Honda City and Honda Accord.
